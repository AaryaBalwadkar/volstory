# 1. Project Vision & ISKCON Mission Alignment

### The Purpose of VolStory
VolStory is not just a standard social or productivity application; it is a dedicated digital ecosystem built to facilitate **Seva (selfless service)** and **Sanga (spiritual community)** within ISKCON temples. 

Managing thousands of volunteers, coordinating grand festivals (like Janmashtami and Ratha Yatra), and maintaining daily temple operations requires robust, enterprise-grade infrastructure. VolStory aims to eliminate administrative friction so that devotees and temple management can focus entirely on their spiritual duties and community building.

### Aligning ISKCON Values with Engineering Principles

As a contributor to this codebase, your technical decisions directly impact the daily lives of the temple congregation. We translate core spiritual and community values into our engineering standards:

* **Seva (Service) translates to User-Centric Reliability:**
    Our code must serve the users flawlessly. Whether a volunteer is signing up for a kitchen shift or a coordinator is broadcasting an urgent message during a crowded Sunday feast, the app cannot crash. This is why we enforce strict offline-first resilience and stringent TypeScript typing. 
* **Sanga (Community) translates to Accessibility & Inclusivity:**
    The ISKCON community spans all age groups and technical proficiencies. The application UI must be built with deep empathy. We apply rigorous design thinking to ensure the app is highly legible, fully accessible (a11y compliant), and intuitively navigable for everyone from university students to senior congregation members.
* **Purity & Respect translates to Strict Data Privacy:**
    We are entrusted with the personal data, schedules, and sometimes donation records of the devotee community. Security is not an afterthought. We strictly separate authentication environments, minimize data collection to what is absolutely necessary, and ensure all PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is handled with the highest level of cryptographic security.

### The Developer Mindset
When you open a Pull Request, remember the context of where this software operates. A dropped frame or a slow loading state isn't just a technical metric; it is a moment of friction for a volunteer trying to offer their time on the temple grounds. 

We build with care, we test rigorously, and we document thoroughly, ensuring that our digital foundation is as enduring and welcoming as the temple itself.
